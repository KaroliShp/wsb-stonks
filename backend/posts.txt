They can trade dick pix with eachother, that will be their new business model.\n\nI knew from the first day those pieces of pedo's were trash, when they responded to a support ticket about a trade related issue a month later with a canned response. When I proceeded to curse them out after the 2nd email exchange in WSB fashion for such disgusting business practice they proceeded to CLOSE my account permanently.\n\nNow it's time you autist retards go full retard and move your brokerage accounts to other brokers, boycott all these pedo scumbags who intentionally manipulated markets today.  \n\nIn conclusion, FUCK ROBINHOOD and VLAD EMO GAYBEAR TENEV pieces of worthless shit.",

Most of us are colorblind and can't tell the difference anyways. Some literally get off on loss, others are completely desensitized to it. Many of us have been in this shit since $10-$40. Conviction is way too strong to sell at a measly $130. That ladder was pretty sick today, ngl, you might've grabbed some paper handers/newblood, but do you think we're fucking BLIND? WE CAN SEE THE TRADING VOLUME. Even though many of us can't buy today, good luck finding enough sellers. Once the floodgates are open, WE LIKE THE STOCK, so people will buy the hell out of it. Hedgies should double down again, I really want that $5k per share. Holding till the bitter end.",
